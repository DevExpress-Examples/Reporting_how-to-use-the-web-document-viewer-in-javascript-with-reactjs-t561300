This example demonstrates how to integrate the [Web Document Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17738/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-webforms-reporting/document-viewer?v=19.1) in JavaScript with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The project uses the [Bower](https://bower.io/) package manager.

For a step-by-step tutorial, refer to the following help topic: [Report Designer Integration in ReactJS](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119338/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/javascript-reporting/document-viewer/integration-examples/document-viewer-integration-in-react?v=19.1).

Starting from v19.2, you should use the **npm package manager**. You can find an updated version of the example here:

- [How to Use the Document Viewer in JavaScript with React Library and Npm Package Manager](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/reporting-document-viewer-in-javascript-with-react)

The current repository and the DevExpress Reporting Bower package will not be updated in the future.
